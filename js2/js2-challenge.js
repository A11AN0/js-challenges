/*

Arrays, Functions and Conditions

Create a list of colors that contains 4 different colors: violet, green, blue, yellow

Create a function that will take two arguments: an array of colors and an index. 
The function will test whether the item at index is not a primary color and if it isn't, replace it with red. The function returns the new array.

Run your tests by running jest. They will all break at first.
