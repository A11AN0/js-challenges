/* This challenge build upon previous knowledge and introduces the concept of complex data types (arrays of objects) */

/* 
  All challenges in this repository are seperated into four levels: Foundation, Intermediate, Advanced and Expert.
  The expectation is to complete all Foundation level challenges, with Intermediate and upwards pushing your knowledge
  and may require you to google things in order to solve them. If you find an answer online somewhere, be kind and
  share it with the group!
*/

/* Foundation Challenges */

// Take a string from each object and put it into an array

// Filter the array based on some condition

// Get an array of just the keys from an object

/* Intermediate Challenges */

// Find the object which matches a certain condition

// Total up a shopping basket (reduce)

// Modify every object in array and return the array of objects

/* Advanced Challenges */

// Return a new array of objects but each object only has a some of the keys

// Check if each object has a certain key, if it doesn't, add a default value (data cleaning)

/* Expert Challenge */

// Check if each object matches the specified structure. Remove unnecessary keys and add default values for missing keys.
