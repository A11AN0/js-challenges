// Classes - Foundation

// Most of it there, have them write method bodies
// Intermediate
// Write a whole class
// - getters
// - setters
// Advanced
// Extend the previous class
// Expert
// Do some weird shit Charlie sends you

/* JS4 builds on the previous challenges and adds the use of Array iterators, Arrays, For Loops, Conditionals (If, else, switch)
 *  & calling your own functions.
 */

/* 
  All challenges in this repository are seperated into four levels: Foundation, Intermediate, Advanced and Expert.
  The expectation is to complete all Foundation level challenges, with Intermediate and upwards pushing your knowledge
  and may require you to google things in order to solve them. If you find an answer online somewhere, be kind and
  share it with the group!
